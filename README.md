# Calculating Family Expenses
ðŸ’° Family Finance Tracker on ServiceNow: Project Summary
Goal
To create a comprehensive, scalable system on ServiceNow for families to track, categorize, and manage their expenses efficiently, promoting informed financial decisions.

Core Functionality
Dual-Table Structure:
Family Expenses: The main parent table for expense summaries.
Daily Expenses: The child table for individual transaction details (who, what, when).
Automated Data Integrity:
A Business Rule ensures the main Family Expenses record is automatically updated (total amount, details) whenever a new or modified daily expense is logged.
Sequential Auto-Numbering (MFE prefix) for both tables ensures clean record IDs.
Intelligent Relationship:
The two tables are linked, and a related list query ensures that only the relevant daily entries (matching by date) are displayed on the parent form.
Key Development Highlights
Setup: Secured a PDI and created the "Family Expenses" Update Set.
Design: Configured forms with mandatory fields (Date, Amount, Family Member Name) and read-only fields (Number).
Access: Created a dedicated "Family Expenditure" menu for easy user navigation.
